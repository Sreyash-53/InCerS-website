    <p> To provide a platform for delegates and professionals from the fields of material science and technology to gather and advance their knowledge and ideas about the materials. It also works to provide exposure to students on material science & technology and to assist them throughout their journey in this field.</p><hr>
    <h1 style="color: red;">FLASHBACK FRIDAY</h1>
    <P>Memories are meant to be remembered, because even the bad memories are usually part of something we once thought was good.Memory is more indelible than ink. Life must be lived forwards, but it can only be understood backwards, through the experience of oneself and others. There is no definitive roadmap to follow for success, while the road is a huge game of Tetris. The inputs that we manage to get, must be arranged in a suitable way to make them advantageous to us. But it is the inputs that are sometimes very difficult to get owing to certain reasons. To help everyone in this regard, NITR-ICS is going to collect such experiences and words of wisdom from successful ceramists, material scientists and industrialists who have excelled in their fields. It will be a conglomeration of important events in their journey from college to where they are now. All the information will be shared fortnightly through the label “Flashback Friday”. Stay tuned for further information.</P><hr>
